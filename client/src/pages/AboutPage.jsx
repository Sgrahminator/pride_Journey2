                    About Pride Journey
                    <br></br>
                    Welcome to Pride Journey, a haven for the LGBTQIA+ community and our cherished allies. 
                    Before diving into the wealth of resources and shared experiences here, let us take you 
                    on a journey of how this platform came to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Origin:
                    <br></br>
                    I grew up in a small town in Florida, part of the United States. A place where the 
                    whispers of the wind carried stories that I felt never truly represented who I was. As 
                    a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, it was not until I discovered the warmth and 
                    acceptance of others like me that I felt truly at home. However, finding these safe 
                    spaces was not always easy. That is why I envisioned a platform where anyone, irrespective 
                    of where they come from, could find or visit a corner of the world where they feel seen, 
                    valued, and cherished.
                </p>

                    What We Do:
                    <br></br>
                    Pride Journey is a national recommendation platform, built by you and for you. From 
                    the cozy cafe some small town in the south to the lively bars in a big city, from 
                    the tranquil beaches of the coasts to the bustling shopping avenues in New York, 
                    this is where you can discover and share spaces that are LGBTQIA+ friendly.
                    <br></br>
                    But we are not just about places. We believe in building a strong, united community 
                    where every individual voice is heard. Every user submission builds upon our collective 
                    experience. It is our shared tapestry, woven with threads of trust, acceptance, and 
                    pride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Promise:
                    <br></br>
                    Respect and safety are at the heart of what we do. At Pride Journey, bullying has 
                    no place. Every member is expected to uphold the values of respect, understanding, 
                    and compassion. Any deviation from these principles is not tolerated. Together, we 
                    aim to make this platform a beacon of positivity, love, and unity for all that come 
                    here. This is a safe space, please keep it as such.
